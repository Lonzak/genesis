 * both left-to-right and right-to-left text then the user-agent uses a complex
 * Unicode algorithm to decide how to display the text. This property overrides
 * this algorithm and allows the developer to control the text embedding.
 *
 * <p>Note: This property is intended for DTD designers. Web designers and
 * similar authors should not override it.</p>
